###### INCA SUNS
# We aim to take a closer look at the methods typically used to account for human 
# benefits of NBFs. In the most simplistic terms, a buffer is taken around the 
# project and the number of people found within that buffer are benefited.
# However, different sizes of buffers, different methods of setting the buffer,
# and different metrics of counting humans benefited have been used to define 
# social benefit from NBF.

# 3 different buffers (300m, 500m, and 1,000m) were produced for each NBS project
# from the TNC SUNS portfolio. The intersection between each of these buffers and
# 2 feet of SLR and the intersection between each of these buffers and FEMA's 
# special flood hazard areas (SFHA) were created. This results in 9 areas of 
# potential human benefit. The sum of people in each of these areas was taken 
# using 1) night time landscan imagery (30m resolution), 2) census block 
# populations intersected with the 9 areas, 3) total buildings within the 
# buffers using the parcel tax database, and 4) the total number of residential 
# serving parcels. Residential serving parcels included, residential parcels,
# public parks, schools, etc.

# When testing the envelope methods individually (i.e. the full buffer around a point and the full buffer around the footprint), 
# both the Landscan and Census provided similar distributions of population counts. 

#Conclusion:
# Yes, population estimates around projects are similar when compairing Landscan and Census. 
# Therefore, we recommend Landscan for future population counts within a project area. 
# This method is similar to the population distribution captured by Census, is easier to use, and has a finer and more precise resolution. 


#Q2: Are there other reasonable metrics for capturing population benefits?
# Another method for capturing social benefits is to count the number of buildings within the 'envelope of resilience'
Q2DF <- subset(INCA, INCA$Method == "Parcel Building Count" & INCA$Area == "Full Buffer")

# The number of buildings surrounding the SUNS projects is between 682 - 33,876 buildings within the 'envelope of resilience'
# These numbers have such a wide spread because the floodplain of a 0.3 km buffer around a point is much smaller than the full 1km buffer around the project footprint.
# These numbers are also lower than the population estimates because they are counting two different things. Population is counting people, and building counts are taking the total buildings within the buffer.

#Conclusion:
# Counting the amount of buildings within the envelope of resilience is another way to showcase the benefits available surrounding SUNS projects. 
# The number of buildings tends to increase the larger the buffer for both footprints and points. 
# Additionally, the footprint estimate is larger than the point estimates. 
# We recommend a 0.5km buffer for the 'envelope of resilience'. 
#   The 1km buffer may over estimate the population benefits and is the most different from the other buffer sizes. 
#   The 0.3km buffer may under estimate the population benefits and may not fully capture building counts and census populations because of resolution differences.
