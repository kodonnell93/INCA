###### INCA SUNS
# We aim to take a closer look at the methods typically used to account for human 
# benefits of NBFs. In the most simplistic terms, a buffer is taken around the 
# project and the number of people found within that buffer are benefited.
# However, different sizes of buffers, different methods of setting the buffer,
# and different metrics of counting humans benefited have been used to define 
# social benefit from NBF.

# 3 different buffers (300m, 500m, and 1,000m) were produced for each NBS project
# from the TNC SUNS portfolio. The intersection between each of these buffers and
# 2 feet of SLR and the intersection between each of these buffers and FEMA's 
# special flood hazard areas (SFHA) were created. This results in 9 areas of 
# potential human benefit. The sum of people in each of these areas was taken 
# using 1) night time landscan imagery (30m resolution), 2) census block 
# populations intersected with the 9 areas, 3) total buildings within the 
# buffers using the parcel tax database, and 4) the total number of residential 
# serving parcels. Residential serving parcels included, residential parcels,
# public parks, schools, etc.
